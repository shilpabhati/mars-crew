		 Rules Of The Game
		</h1>
		
		<p>
		 The game is played on a 3*3 grid
			<br/>
			<br/>
		 Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		 The first player to get 3 of her/his marks up, down, across or diagonally is the winner.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		 When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
			<br/>
